	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I used a corpus of the 10 highest [2016] paid male athletes, and female athletes, that is a total of 20 athletes, to filter streamed twitter data.
		Running my script for around 8 hours provided ~560 mb of data which I used in this preliminary study.  
		I used the Python library called tweepy to connect to Twitter API and downloading the data from Twitter;
		then I used pandas, with matplotlib, scipy and numpy for data analysis. I performed sentiment analysis 
		and associated tweets with 3 sentiments, positive, negative and neutral. 
		I used the textblob library for sentiment analysis.</p>
