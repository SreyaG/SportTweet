	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>
	The first graph I have presented is study of the sentiment divided by gender. 
	Tweets associated with male athletes showed a dominating 66.1% of neutral sentiment, followed by a 28.1% of positive sentiment 
	and 5.8% of negative sentiment. Following this trend tweets about female athletes too showed 49.4% of positive sentiment, 
	followed by 46.8% of neutral sentiment and finally 3.8% negative sentiment.  This initial investigation shows that this data is 
	fairly distributed across genders. But there was a caveat, with Serena Williams announcing her pregnancy, 
	a lot of tweets congratulated her on her motherhood. I took out data for Serena Williams (who is the highest paid female athlete 
	in the world) and new relations came to light with negative tweets regarding female athletes increasing to 13.6% reducing both 
	positive and neutral tweets to 47.3% and 39.1% respectively. This highlights the harsher criticism towards female athletes 
	than their male counterparts as well as higher praise.

	The second graph I present is a study of sentiment of tweets athletes further classified by region. 
	Although the total number of tweets regarding female and male athletes was nearly alike, there were 8 countries predominantly 
	tweeting about female athletes while there were 18 countries tweeting about their male counterparts.  
	USA tweeted the highest number of tweets for female athletes, combining positive, neutral and negative tweets. 
	Brasil on the other hand had the highest number of tweets for male athletes with all of them neutral.
