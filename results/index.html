	<h1>Results</h1>

	<h3> Observations I</h3>
	<p> The number of countries tweeting about atheletes, when divided by gender, is startkly different, with 60 countries tweeting about male athletes
	 while only 26 countires tweeted about female athletes, i.e. only 43% of the countries that tweeted about male athletes also tweeted about female athletes. 
	 The total number of tweets for female athletes was 36,141 while for male it was 131181, i.e. only 21% of all the tweets were about women. The distribution of 
	 tweets based on country is shown below.

	<h3> Observations II </h3>
	<p>
	Tweets associated with male athletes showed a dominating 54.7% of neutral sentiment, followed by a 38.6% of positive sentiment 
	and 6.7% of negative sentiment. Following this trend tweets about female athletes too showed 48.1% of positive sentiment, 
	followed by 44.7% of neutral sentiment and finally 7.2% negative sentiment.  This initial investigation shows that this data is 
	fairly distributed across genders.</p>
	<p> But there was a caveat, with Serena Williams announcing her pregnancy, 
	a lot of tweets congratulated her on her motherhood. I took out data for Serena Williams (who is the highest paid female athlete 
	in the world) and new relations came to light with negative tweets regarding female athletes increasing to 12.0% (4.8% increase) reducing both 
	positive tweets to 40.8% and increasing neutral tweets to 47.2% respectively. For comparision I filtered out tweets for Cristiano Ronaldo who is the highest paid
	male athlete, which introduced a smaller increment of only 1.1% in negative tweets, i.e. the new data-set had only 7.8% negative tweets and 36.9% positive tweets
    and 55.2% neutral tweets.	
	This highlights the harsher criticism towards female athletes than their male counterparts.
