	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This project has the scope, and requires additional work. A chunk of the data did not have 
  geotags, pre-filtering the twitter stream can improve the quality of data. An off-the-shelf sentiment analyzer textblob was used here, 
  which in the future will be exclusively written for this this data set, with an improved sentiment corpus. 
  Handling of errors, outliers and trends will also be focused upon to provide unique insights into the data. </p>
