	<!--<h3>Mining Sentiment from Twitter Data to Observe the Role of Gender in Opinions about Athletes</h3>
	<p> Social media has been a boon to data analysts, allowing data scientists to directly collect data from individuals. 
	Twitter has been leading at the forefront with more than 500 million tweets a day for analysis, offering opinions on politics, entertainment,
	sports, and fairly everything under the sun. </p>
	<p>For my project I mined Twitter data to observe the role of gender in opinions about sport personalities.
	I analyzed tweets to indentify sentiment associated tweets. I further classified the sentiment tagged tweets 
	into categories based on gender i.e. male v/s female athletes. 	I also used region to understand sentiment based on 
	gender in the regional context of this data.
		This study has a dual impact:</p>
		<ol>
		<li> Allows brands to appropriately chose brand-ambassadors 
		     for regions where impact of a certain sports personality is higher; and schedule sporting events. </li> 
		<li> Improved understanding of gender bias in sport and possible remedial actions.</li>
		</ol>-->
