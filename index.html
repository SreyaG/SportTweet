	<h3>Mining Sentiment in Twitter data to Observe the Role of Gender in Tweets about Athletes</h3>
	<p>
		Social media has been a boon to data analysis, allowing data scientists to directly collect data from individuals, 
		with Twitter leading at the forefront with more than 500 million tweets a day for analysis. 
		I intend to mine this data to observe the role of gender in in individual opinion about sport personalities. 
		I will analyze tweets to understand sentiment associated with male vs female athletes. 
		I will also study the regional context of this data. 
		This study has a dual impact:</p>
		<ol>
		<li> This information allows brands to appropriately chose brand-ambassadors 
		     to regions where impact of a certain sports personality is higher; and schedule sporting events. </li> 
		<li> Improved understanding of gender bias in sport and possible remedial actions.</li>
		</ol>
